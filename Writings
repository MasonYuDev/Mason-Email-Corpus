Sample 1: 

Project Description & Goal
Lead growth SEO programmatic process buildout and launch(es) for MarketerHire that will see XXX (pending SEO & database audit) pages published with a projected XXX traffic per month. Concept 1 will be the role cluster pages, ie: “[Marketer Role] for [Company Type/Size/Industry]”.

Key Assumptions
There exists ample search demand and role types for MarketerHire that a programmatic build makes sense
Current tech stack will not be a hindrance, or approval of additional software will be quick
I will have access to quick approval and developer assistance to launch the pages if CMS doesn’t make it easy. 

Roadmap
A full concept usually takes 2 months but we can try to rush it in 1 month.

Fees and Schedule
Concept 1’s launch is proposed to be $12,000 for a full build of Phase 1-3.
$6,000 due at start of engagement
$6,000 due after successful launch of Phase 3

Since you mentioned a 1 month deadline, I will try to rush it. The earliest I can guarantee launch is September 18. Since I’ll be starting my MBA program September 11, I’ll need at least 1 week afterwards in case it gets busy

Additional phases to be discussed, I’m particularly interested in continuing to develop innovative growth plays for MarketerHire that extend beyond AI programmatic, so I wanted to put it out there.

Sample 2:
When I was a professional violinist, I worked with Music for Food, a Boston-based nonprofit. Its mission: unite musicians and combat food insecurity by organizing musician-led benefit concerts for selected food pantries. What made this experience meaningful was the active engagement with a local food pantry. Musicians like me visited the pantry, forging a connection with pantry volunteers who attended our concerts to advocate for their cause.

Initially, I served as an educational fellow, visiting middle and high schools in Boston. Our mission was to ignite passion and inspire students to organize their own Music for Food concerts. Witnessing these young minds channel their creativity into fundraising events was incredibly gratifying, knowing that they were becoming the future leaders committed to social impact.

Later, I secured a grant to establish a Music for Food chapter in Washington DC. My quartet organized three successful concerts in partnership with the University of Maryland, generating enough funds to provide 15,000 meals in the metro-DC area.

This long collaboration with Music for Food exposed me to diverse groups—students of all ages, minorities, low-income households, nonprofit organizers, and volunteers. This journey defined my music career where I always made a conscious choice to integrate this concept, visiting schools and underserved organizations to share our music.
